===============
As this is a public repository I have removed many components from the App. However, hopefully there is enough code to get a flavour of Yii and my use of it.

Looks prettier in Sublime Text. Not sure what GitHub has done to my white space. Guess that's a learning curve for me.

All Yii application specific code is inside the protected folder. Ignore the extensions folder, it is all 3rd party code but it is referenced so I have left it. There is a chance if you look deeply enough you will find referenced components that I have removed.
